### CSCI349: Introduction to Data Mining

#### Jake Schaeffer Final project

Using data from Summer Olympic games of years passed, 
I will attempt to predict the winning countries for select sports.
The data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games/data)

I found that it is difficult to create a classification task when one is not immediately obvious, but it is fun to gather incites from data. You get in a groove and just want to keep digging deeper.
I am slightly embarassed by the quality of my work, but I am happy that it helped me to learn that machine learning is not really my thing, but gathering statistical incites certainly is.
Overall I enjoyed this project and the things it has shown me are possible.
